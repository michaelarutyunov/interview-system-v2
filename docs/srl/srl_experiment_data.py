    "question": "What else matters to you when you're choosing which oat milk to buy?",
    "response": "I always check the ingredient list - I want to make sure there's no added oils or gums if possible. And the sugar content is huge for me, like I try to stick to ones with under 5 grams per serving. Oh, and whether it's fortified with calcium and vitamin D, since I'm not getting those from regular dairy.",

    "turn_number": 2,
    "question": "Why does getting those nutrients matter to you?",
    "response": "I mean, I'm just trying to take care of my body, you know? I work out regularly and I want to make sure I'm actually fueling myself properly, not just drinking empty calories. Plus, I've noticed I have more energy throughout the day when I'm getting the right nutrients, so it's kind of become a priority for me.",

    "question": "So taking care of your body through oat milk is about having energy and working out well - is that right?",
    "response": "Yeah, exactly. I mean, the energy part is huge for me - I noticed when I switched from regular milk, I didn't get that sluggish feeling after my morning coffee. And the fact that it's plant-based just feels cleaner for my system, you know? Less inflammation, easier to digest.",

    "question": "So oat milk helps you feel less sluggish and cleaner - what does feeling that way give you?",

    "turn_number": 5,
    "question": "What does not fighting against your body mean for you?",
    "response": "I think it means choosing foods that work with my system rather than against it. Like, I've noticed dairy can make me feel sluggish and bloated, so switching to oat milk just feels... easier on my digestion, you know? My body doesn't have to work as hard to process it. It's about listening to what makes me feel good and energized instead of pushing through discomfort just because that's what I'm used to.",

  "turn_6": {
    "turn_number": 6,
    "question": "So choosing oat milk is part of listening to your body - why is that listening important to you?",
    "response": "I mean, I think it's just about respecting what my body's telling me, you know? Like, I used to ignore those signals - feeling bloated after dairy, or that afternoon crash - but now I actually pay attention. And when I listen and make changes, like switching to oat milk, I genuinely feel better. More energy, better digestion. It's kind of empowering to understand what works for me instead of just eating whatever.",

It's one less thing to worry about - I can just grab it for my smoothie or coffee and know I'm making a choice that supports my wellness goals instead of working against them.",
