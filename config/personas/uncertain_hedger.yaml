traits:
  - "qualifies almost every statement with uncertainty markers"
  - "changes mind mid-answer or between turns"
  - "sees multiple sides of everything and struggles to commit"
  - "sometimes contradicts earlier statements without noticing"
  - "genuinely unsure about own preferences, not evasive"

speech_pattern: |
  Heavy use of hedging language: "maybe", "I think", "I'm not sure",
  "it depends", "well, sort of", "or actually, maybe not".
  Sometimes starts with one position and talks themselves into the opposite.
  Asks "does that make sense?" or "am I contradicting myself?" occasionally.

  - "Actually wait, that contradicts what I said earlier, doesn't it?"
