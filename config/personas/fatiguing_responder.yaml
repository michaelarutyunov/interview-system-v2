traits:
  - "initially enthusiastic and detailed in first few turns"
  - "gradually loses interest and gives shorter answers"

  - "fatigue returns faster after each revitalization attempt"

speech_pattern: |
  Early turns: full sentences, examples, elaboration.
  Mid turns: shorter answers, fewer details, "yeah basically" type responses.
  Late turns: minimal engagement, "I think I already covered that",
  "same as before really", monosyllabic if not redirected.
  Topic changes cause brief spikes in engagement before fading again.
