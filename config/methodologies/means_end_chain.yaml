# Methodology-specific extraction guidelines
extraction_guidelines:
  - "For Means-End Chain interviews, extract BOTH explicit AND implicit relationships"
  - "Explicit: Look for causal markers like 'because', 'so', 'that's why', 'leads to'"
  - "Implicit (MEC chains): When multiple concepts are mentioned in the same response, connect them if they form a logical means-end chain"
  - "Contextual: If the interviewer asks 'why does X matter' and the response describes Y, create X→Y relationship"
  - "For Means-End Chain interviews, create edges between concepts that represent the chain of reasoning, even when no explicit connector is used"
  - "attribute → functional_consequence (features → outcomes)"
  - "functional_consequence → psychosocial_consequence (outcomes → feelings)"
  - "psychosocial_consequence → instrumental_value (feelings → goals)"
  - "instrumental_value → terminal_value (goals → life values)"
  - "Target 2-3x more edges than nodes for a well-structured MEC graph"
  - "Prefer creating relationships over leaving concepts disconnected"

# Methodology-specific relationship extraction examples
relationship_examples:
  explicit_causal:
    description: "Discourse markers explicitly state the connection"
    example: "I like froth because it makes coffee less bitter"
    extraction: "froth → makes coffee taste less bitter"

  implicit_same_response:
    description: "Multiple concepts in one response form logical consequence chain"
    example: "Froth makes coffee taste less bitter and gives a nice sensation in the mouth"
    extraction: "makes coffee taste less bitter → nice sensation in the mouth"

  implicit_conversational:
    description: "Question establishes antecedent, response provides consequence"
    example: "Interviewer: 'Why does the nice sensation matter?' Respondent: 'It feels like a good start of the day'"
    extraction: "nice sensation in the mouth → good start of the day"

  value_progression:
    description: "Parallel goals forming a chain toward terminal value"
    example: "I can be my best and set a good example to my kids"
    extraction: "be my best → set a good example to my kids"

# Methodology-specific extractability criteria
extractability_criteria:
  extractable_contains:
    - "Product attributes, features, or characteristics"
    - "Benefits, outcomes, or consequences"
    - "Feelings, emotions, or social implications"
    - "Values or life goals"
    - "Causal relationships between any of the above"
  non_extractable_contains:
    - "Simple yes/no responses"
    - "Acknowledgments ('okay', 'I see')"
    - "Questions back to the interviewer"
    - "Off-topic tangents"
    - "Very short responses with no substance"
