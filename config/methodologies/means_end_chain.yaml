# Means-End Chain Methodology Configuration
#
# MEC explores chains from attributes → consequences → values
# by asking "why is that important?" to probe deeper.

ontology:
  nodes:
    - name: attribute
      level: 1

      examples:
        - "creamy texture"
        - "plant-based"
        - "sustainable packaging"

    - name: functional_consequence
      level: 2
      terminal: false
      description: "Tangible outcome from using the product"
      examples:
        - "easier to digest"
        - "mixes well with coffee"

    - name: psychosocial_consequence
      level: 3
      terminal: false
      description: "Emotional or social outcome"
      examples:
        - "feel healthier"
        - "gain respect from peers"

    - name: instrumental_value
      level: 4
      terminal: false
      description: "Preferred mode of behavior"
      examples:
        - "being responsible"
        - "taking care of myself"

    - name: terminal_value
      level: 5
      terminal: true
      description: "End-state of existence, core life goal"
      examples:
        - "self-respect"
        - "sense of accomplishment"
        - "family security"

  edges:
    - name: leads_to
      description: "Causal or enabling relationship"
      permitted_connections:
        - [attribute, attribute]
        - [attribute, functional_consequence]
        - [functional_consequence, functional_consequence]
        - [functional_consequence, psychosocial_consequence]
        - [psychosocial_consequence, psychosocial_consequence]
        - [psychosocial_consequence, instrumental_value]

        - [instrumental_value, terminal_value]

    - name: revises
      description: "Contradiction - newer belief supersedes older one"
      permitted_connections:
        - ["*", "*"]

  extraction_guidelines:
    - "For Means-End Chain interviews, extract BOTH explicit AND implicit relationships"
    - "Explicit: Look for causal markers like 'because', 'so', 'that's why', 'leads to'"
    - "Implicit (MEC chains): When multiple concepts are mentioned in the same response, connect them if they form a logical means-end chain"
    - "Contextual: If the interviewer asks 'why does X matter' and the response describes Y, create X→Y relationship"
    - "For Means-End Chain interviews, create edges between concepts that represent the chain of reasoning, even when no explicit connector is used"
    - "attribute → functional_consequence (features → outcomes)"
    - "functional_consequence → psychosocial_consequence (outcomes → feelings)"
    - "psychosocial_consequence → instrumental_value (feelings → goals)"
    - "instrumental_value → terminal_value (goals → life values)"
    - "Target 2-3x more edges than nodes for a well-structured MEC graph"
    - "Prefer creating relationships over leaving concepts disconnected"

  relationship_examples:
    explicit_causal:
      description: "Discourse markers explicitly state the connection"
      example: "I like froth because it makes coffee less bitter"
      extraction: "froth → makes coffee taste less bitter"

    implicit_same_response:
      description: "Multiple concepts in one response form logical consequence chain"
      example: "Froth makes coffee taste less bitter and gives a nice sensation in the mouth"
      extraction: "makes coffee taste less bitter → nice sensation in the mouth"

    implicit_conversational:
      description: "Question establishes antecedent, response provides consequence"
      example: "Interviewer: 'Why does the nice sensation matter?' Respondent: 'It feels like a good start of the day'"
      extraction: "nice sensation in the mouth → good start of the day"

    value_progression:
      description: "Parallel goals forming a chain toward terminal value"
      example: "I can be my best and set a good example to my kids"
      extraction: "be my best → set a good example to my kids"

  extractability_criteria:
    extractable_contains:
      - "Product attributes, features, or characteristics"
      - "Benefits, outcomes, or consequences"
      - "Feelings, emotions, or social implications"
      - "Values or life goals"
      - "Causal relationships between any of the above"
    non_extractable_contains:
      - "Simple yes/no responses"
      - "Acknowledgments ('okay', 'I see')"
      - "Questions back to the interviewer"
      - "Off-topic tangents"
      - "Very short responses with no substance"
