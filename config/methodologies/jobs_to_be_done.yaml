extraction_guidelines:
  - "Listen for phrases indicating what the user is trying to accomplish ('I need to...', 'I want to...', 'The goal is...')"
  - "Identify the circumstances when the job becomes important ('when...', 'especially when...', 'in situations like...')"
  - "Extract pain points directly expressed ('frustrating that...', 'hate it when...', 'problem is...')"
  - "Extract gain points as positive outcomes ('love that...', 'great because...', 'important that...')"
  - "Distinguish between functional, emotional, and social jobs - often all three coexist"
  - "Map the current solution approach even if not explicitly stated"
  - "Connect jobs to their underlying emotional and social drivers"
  - "Look for trade-offs users make between competing jobs"

relationship_examples:
  explicit_job_statement:
    description: "Direct statement of what needs to be accomplished"
    example: "I need something that wakes me up but doesn't make me jittery"
    extraction: "job_statement('wake up without jitters') → addresses → pain_point('caffeine jitters')"

  implicit_context:
    description: "Context revealed through situation description"
    example: "When I have 8am meetings, I can't wait in line at the cafe"
    extraction: "job_statement('get morning coffee') → occurs_in → job_context('early morning meetings')"

  pain_trigger_chain:
    description: "Trigger reveals the pain point and the job together"
    example: "Dairy makes me feel bloated, especially before presentations"
    extraction: "job_trigger('before presentations') → triggered_by → job_statement('feel comfortable') conflicts_with pain_point('dairy bloating')"

  functional_supports_emotional:
    description: "Functional choice enables emotional outcome"
    example: "I choose oat milk because it aligns with my values"
    extraction: "solution_approach('oat milk') → supports → emotional_job('feel environmentally responsible')"
