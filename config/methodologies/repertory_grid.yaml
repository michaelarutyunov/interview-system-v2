extraction_guidelines:
  - "Use triadic elicitation: 'In what way are two of these similar but different from the third?'"
  - "Always capture both poles of each construct (bipolar nature is essential)"
  - "Extract ratings or preferences when explicitly stated"
  - "Look for laddering: 'Why does X matter?' → reveals higher-level constructs"
  - "Identify the 'ideal' product description"
  - "Notice which elements are grouped as similar"
  - "Pay attention to the language used - personal constructs reveal the person's meaning system"
  - "Constructs can be functional (creamy), emotional (comforting), or value-based (responsible)"

relationship_examples:
  triadic_elicitation:
    description: "Comparing three items to elicit constructs"
    example: "Interviewer: 'How are oat and almond similar but different from dairy?' Response: 'Oat and almond are plant-based, but dairy comes from animals'"
    extraction: |
      element('oat milk') → similar_on → construct_pole('plant-based')
      element('almond milk') → similar_on → construct_pole('plant-based')
      element('dairy milk') → differs_on → construct_pole('plant-based')
      construct_pole('plant-based') → opposite_of → construct_pole('animal-based')

  bipolar_construct:
    description: "Both poles of a construct"
    example: "I like things that are creamy, not watery"
    extraction: "construct_pole('creamy') → opposite_of → construct_pole('watery')"

  laddering:
    description: "Higher-level construct revealed"
    example: "Creaminess matters because it feels indulgent, and that's how I practice self-care"
    extraction: |
      construct_pole('creamy') → implies → construct_pole('indulgent')
      construct_pole('indulgent') → implies → construct_pole('self-care')

  ideal_specification:
    description: "Description of perfect product"
    example: "Ideally, something that froths like dairy but has the sustainability of oat"
    extraction: |
      ideal_element('perfect milk') ← closer_to_ideal ← element('oat milk')
      construct_pole('froths well') → defines → ideal_element('perfect milk')
      construct_pole('sustainable') → defines → ideal_element('perfect milk')
