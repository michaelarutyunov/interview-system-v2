# Spec 3.2: Coverage Scorer

## Objective
Create the coverage scorer to ensure all stimulus elements are addressed.

## Context
- Reference: PRD Section 5.2.2 (Coverage strategies), IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Section 3.2
- v1 Reference: `/home/mikhailarutyunov/projects/graph-enabled-ai-interviewer/src/modules/scorers/element_coverage_scorer.py`
- Key simplification: Stimulus elements tracked in session config (not separate model)
- Boosts coverage strategies when gaps exist

## Input Files
- `src/services/scoring/base.py` - From spec 3.1
- v1: `/home/mikhailarutyunov/projects/graph-enabled-ai-interviewer/src/modules/scorers/element_coverage_scorer.py`

## Output Files

### src/services/scoring/coverage.py
```python
"""Coverage scorer - ensures stimulus elements are addressed.

Boosts coverage strategies when gaps exist in the interview.

    - 1.0 = complete coverage (no gaps)

## Requirements
1. Extends ScorerBase
2. Reads coverage from graph_state.properties (elements_total, elements_seen)
3. Only affects strategies with type_category="coverage"
4. Higher boost when coverage_ratio < threshold

## Verification
```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/unit/test_coverage_scorer.py -v

# Verify import
python3 -c "from src.services.scoring.coverage import CoverageScorer; print('OK')"
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `CoverageScorer` class extends `ScorerBase`
- [ ] Reads `elements_total` and `elements_seen` from graph_state.properties
- [ ] Boosts coverage strategies when coverage_ratio < threshold
- [ ] Returns 1.0 for non-coverage strategies
- [ ] All tests pass
