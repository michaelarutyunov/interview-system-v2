# Methodology Configuration Schema
#
# Defines the structure for methodology YAML configs.
# Each methodology specifies which signals to use and defines strategies.

methodology:
  name: str              # Unique methodology identifier (e.g., "means_end_chain")
  description: str       # Human-readable description

  # Signals to include (select from pools)
  signals:
    graph: list[str]     # Graph-derived signals: ["graph.node_count", "graph.max_depth", ...]
    llm: list[str]       # LLM-derived signals: ["llm.response_depth", "llm.sentiment", ...]
    temporal: list[str]  # Temporal signals: ["temporal.strategy_repetition_count", ...]
    meta: list[str]      # Meta signals: ["meta.interview_progress", ...]

  # Strategies defined per-methodology (NOT shared pool)
  strategies:
    - name: str                  # Strategy name (e.g., "deepen", "explore")
      technique: str              # Technique to use: "laddering", "elaboration", "probing", "validation"
      signal_weights: dict        # Signal weights for scoring (e.g., {"llm.response_depth.surface": 0.8})
      focus_preference: str       # Focus selection: "shallow", "recent", "related", "deep"
