      "question": "Thanks so much for joining me today! I'm really interested in learning about your experiences with plant-based milk alternatives \u2013 things like almond milk, oat milk, soy milk, and so on.\n\nTo get us started, can you walk me through the last time you were shopping for milk and tell me what went through your mind when you were deciding which one to buy?",
      "response": "Oh yeah, so I was at Whole Foods last week actually. I stood there for a bit comparing the oat milk options \u2013 there are so many now! I immediately flipped a few cartons around to check the ingredients list. I was looking for one without added oils or gums, you know, the cleaner the better. I ended up going with one that had just oats, water, and a little sea salt. It had more fiber than some of the other brands too, which is a nice bonus for gut health.",

      "response": "I try to be really mindful about what I'm putting in my body, you know? I feel like when I stick to cleaner ingredients - like things I can actually recognize and pronounce - I just feel better overall. Less bloated, more energy. Plus, I've read enough about how certain additives can mess with your gut health over time, and I'd rather not deal with that down the road.",

      "response": "I'd say it's like... I notice I'm not getting that afternoon crash, you know? Like when I have my coffee with regular milk, I sometimes feel kind of sluggish later. But with oat milk, especially one with good fiber content, my energy feels more stable throughout the day. And honestly, my digestion just feels cleaner - I'm not dealing with any bloating or that heavy feeling. It's subtle, but I definitely notice the difference in how my body responds.",

I'm not reaching for sugary snacks or extra coffee to power through, which I think is better for my body long-term. Plus, I can actually make it to the gym after work instead of just wanting to collapse on the couch.",

Plus, I think about it as an investment - like, if I'm taking care of myself now, hopefully I'm preventing health issues down the road. My mom has struggled with some digestive problems and high cholesterol, so I've seen firsthand how diet really impacts your quality of life as you get older.",

Choosing oat milk is part of how I take care of myself, you know? It's one of those daily decisions that adds up over time.",

      "question": "Why does having that peace of mind about your health matter to you?",
      "response": "You know, I think it's because I've seen too many people in my family deal with health issues that could've been prevented. My dad has type 2 diabetes, and watching him manage that has made me really conscious about what I'm putting in my body now rather than dealing with consequences later. Plus, I just feel better when I know I'm nourishing myself properly - like I'm actually taking care of my future self, not just getting through the day.",
