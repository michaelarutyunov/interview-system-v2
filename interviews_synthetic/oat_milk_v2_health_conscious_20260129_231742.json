      "question": "Thanks so much for joining me today! I'm really interested in learning about your experiences with plant-based milk alternatives \u2013 things like oat milk, almond milk, soy milk, and so on.\n\nTo start off, can you walk me through the last time you were shopping for milk \u2013 whether dairy or plant-based \u2013 and tell me what was going through your mind as you were standing there looking at the options?",
      "response": "Oh yeah, so I was actually at Whole Foods last week picking up groceries. I stood in front of the dairy case for probably like five minutes because there are just so many options now, you know? I was specifically looking at the oat milk section because that's what I've been into lately. I was comparing the Oatly barista blend with this other organic brand, and I had both cartons in my hands just flipping them over to read the ingredient lists. I'm really careful about added sugars and any weird stabilizers or gums they put in there. I ended up going with the one that had fewer ingredients and no added oils \u2013 I think it was like oats, water, and a little sea salt. Clean ingredients are really important to me because I'm trying to avoid inflammatory foods.",

      "question": "Why does avoiding inflammatory foods matter to you?",
      "response": "I've noticed I just feel better overall when I cut out things that cause inflammation. Like, I used to get really bloated and sluggish after meals, and once I started paying attention to what I was eating - cutting out a lot of dairy and processed stuff - that went away. Plus, I read a lot about how chronic inflammation is linked to so many health issues down the road, so it feels like I'm investing in my long-term wellness, you know?",

Like, I don't get those afternoon crashes anymore since I've been more intentional about what I'm putting in my body. And honestly, it just makes me feel more in control \u2013 knowing I'm doing something good for my long-term health, reducing inflammation, supporting my gut health.

      "question": "Why does having that peace of mind matter to you?",
      "response": "I think it's because I'm really conscious about what I'm putting in my body on a daily basis. Like, oat milk is something I use in my coffee every morning and in smoothies, so it adds up over time, you know? If there are weird additives or questionable ingredients, that's just accumulating in my system. I want to feel good about my choices and know they're supporting my overall wellness, not working against it.",
