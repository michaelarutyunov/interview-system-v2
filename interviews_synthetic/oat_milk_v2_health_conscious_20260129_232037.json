      "question": "Thanks so much for joining me today! I'm really interested in learning about your experiences with plant-based milk alternatives \u2013 things like almond milk, oat milk, soy milk, and so on.\n\nTo get us started, can you walk me through the last time you were shopping for milk alternatives? What do you remember about that experience \u2013 where were you, what were you looking at, what was going through your mind?",
      "response": "Oh yeah, I was actually at Whole Foods last week looking for oat milk. I spent a good amount of time in that aisle comparing labels \u2013 you know, checking the sugar content, making sure there weren't any weird additives or gums. I ended up going with the Oatly barista blend because it had minimal ingredients and no added oils, which I try to avoid. I remember there were so many options though, and honestly some of them had way more sugar than I expected for something that's supposed to be a healthier alternative.",

      "response": "I try to avoid processed ingredients because I've read they can cause inflammation in the body, and I just feel better when I stick to cleaner foods. Like, my digestion is way better when I'm not consuming a bunch of additives, and I'm trying to be more mindful about what I'm putting into my body long-term, you know?",

I try to focus on whole, minimally processed foods and ingredients I can actually recognize and pronounce, you know? It's not about being perfect, but just being mindful that my body is going to be with me for hopefully a long time, so I want to treat it well.",

I've noticed such a difference in my energy levels and just overall how I feel when I'm putting good things in versus processed stuff. Plus, my mom dealt with a lot of health issues that probably could've been prevented with better nutrition, so I'm trying to be more proactive about it now rather than dealing with problems later.",

      "response": "I think it's about making intentional choices, you know? Like, I'm actively choosing something plant-based that's easier on my digestive system and has fiber, which is good for gut health. Plus, I'm avoiding the hormones and antibiotics that can be in regular dairy. It's one of those daily decisions that adds up - like, I'm not just reacting to feeling bad, I'm preventing issues before they start. And honestly, knowing it's fortified with vitamins D and B12 makes me feel like I'm actually nourishing my body, not just drinking something tasty.",
